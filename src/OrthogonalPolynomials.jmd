# Orthogonal Polynomials

Fourier series proved very powerful for approximating periodic functions.
If periodicity is lost, however, uniform convergence is lost. In this chapter
we introduce alternative bases, _orthogonal polynomials (OPs)_ built on polynomials that are applicable in
the non-periodic setting. In addition to numerics, OPs play a very important role in many mathematical areas
including functional analysis, integrable systems, singular integral equations,
complex analysis, and random matrix theory.

1. General properties of OPs: we define orthogonal polynomials, three-term recurrences and Jacobi operators
2. Classical OPs: we define Chebyshev, Legendre, Jacobi, Laguerre, and Hermite. 
3. Recurrence relationships: we see that classical OPs have many simple recurrences that
are of importance in computation.


## 1. General properties of orthogonal polynomials 

**Definition (graded polynomial basis)** 
A set of polynomials $\{p_0(x), p_1(x), ‚Ä¶ \}$ is _graded_ if $p_n$ is
precisely degree $n$: i.e.,
$$
p_n(x) = k_n x^n + k_n^{(n-1)} x^{n-1} + ‚ãØ + k_n^{(1)} x + k_n^{(0)}
$$
for $k_n ‚â†¬†0$. 

Note that if $p_n$ are graded then $\{p_0(x), ‚Ä¶, p_n(x) \}$
are a basis of all polynomials of degree $n$.


**Definition (orthogonal polynomials)** 
Given a _weight_ $w(x) > 0$ for $x ‚àà (a,b)$,
and a continuous inner product
$$
‚ü®f,g‚ü© = ‚à´_a^b  f(x) g(x) w(x) {\rm d} x
$$
a graded polynomial basis $\{p_0(x), p_1(x), ‚Ä¶ \}$
are _orthogonal polynomials (OPs)_ if
$$
‚ü®p_n,p_m‚ü© = 0
$$
whenever $n ‚â† m$.


Note in the above
$$
h_n := ‚ü®p_n,p_n‚ü© = \|p_n\|^2 = ‚à´_a^b  p_n(x)^2 w(x) {\rm d} x > 0.
$$

**Definition (orthonormal polynomials)**
A set of orthogonal polynomials $\{q_0(x), q_1(x), ‚Ä¶ \}$
are orthonormal if $\|q_n\| = 1$.


**Proposition (expansion)**
If $r(x) is a degree $n$ polynomial, $\{p_n\}$ are orthogonal
and $\{q_n \}$ are orthonormal then
$$
\begin{align*}
r(x) &= ‚àë_{k=0}^n {‚ü®p_k,r‚ü© \over \|p_k\|^2} p_k(x) \\
     &    = ‚àë_{k=0}^n ‚ü®q_k,r‚ü© q_k(x)
\end{align*}
$$

**Proof**
Because $\{p_0,‚Ä¶,p_n \}$ are a basis of polynomials we can
write
$$
r(x) = ‚àë_{k=0}^n r_k p_k(x)
$$
for constants $r_k ‚àà ‚Ñù$.
By linearity we have
$$
‚ü®p_m,r‚ü© = ‚àë_{k=0}^n r_k ‚ü®p_m,p_k‚ü©= r_m ‚ü®p_m,p_m‚ü©
$$
‚àé

**Corollary (zero inner product)**
If a degree $n$ polynomial $r$ satisfies
$$
0 = ‚ü®p_0,r‚ü© = ‚Ä¶ = ‚ü®p_n,r‚ü©
$$
then $r = 0$.


OPs are uniquely defined (up to a constant) by the
property that they are orthogonal to all lower degree polynomials.

**Proposition (orthogonal to lower degree)** 
A polynomial $p$ of precisely degree $n$ satisfies
$$
‚ü®p,r‚ü© = 0
$$
for all degree $m < n$ polynomials $r$ if and only if
$p = c q_n$. Therefore an orthogonal polynomial is uniquely
defined by $k_n$. 

**Proof**
As $\{p_0,‚Ä¶,p_n\}$ are a basis of all polynomials of degree $n$,
we can write
$$
r(x) = ‚àë_{k=0}^m a_k p_k(x)
$$
Thus by linearity of inner products we have
$$
‚ü®cp_n,‚àë_{k=0}^m a_k p_k‚ü© = ‚àë_{k=0}^m ca_k ‚ü®p_n, p_k‚ü© = 0.
$$

Now for
$$
p(x) = c x^n + O(x^{n-1})
$$
consider $p(x) - c p_n(x)$ which is of degree $n-1$. It satisfies
for $k ‚â§¬†n-1
$$
‚ü®p_k, p - c p_n‚ü© = ‚ü®p_k, p‚ü© - c ‚ü®p_k, p_n‚ü© = 0.
$$
Thus it is zero, i.e., $p(x) = c p_n(x)$.

A consequence of this is that orthonormal polynomials are always a
constant multiple of orthogonal polynomials.

The most _fundamental_ property of orthogonal polynomials is their three-term
recurrence.

**Theorem (3-term recurrence, 2nd form)**
If $\{p_n\}$ are OPs then there exist real constants
$a_n, b_n ‚â†0,c_{n-1} ‚â†0$
such that
$$
\begin{align*}
x p_0(x) &= a_0 p_0(x) + b_0 p_1(x)  \\
x p_n(x) &= c_{n-1} p_{n-1}(x) + a_n p_n(x) + b_n p_{n+1}(x) 
\end{align*}
$$
**Proof**
The $n=0$ case is immediate since $\{p_0,p_1}$ are a basis of degree 1 polynomials.
The $n >0$ case follows from 
$$
‚ü®x p_n, p_k‚ü© = ‚ü® p_n, xp_k‚ü© = 0
$$
for $k < n-1$ as $x p_k$ is of degree $k+1 < n$.

Note that
$$
b_n = {‚ü®p_{n+1}, x p_n‚ü© \over \|p_{n+1} \|^2} ‚â†¬†0
$$
since $x p_n = k_n x^{n+1} + O(x^n)$ is precisely degree
$n$. Further,
$$
c_{n-1} = {‚ü®p_{n-1}, x p_n‚ü© \over \|p_{n-1}\|^2 } = 
{‚ü®p_n, x p_{n-1}‚ü©  \over \|p_{n-1}\|^2 } =  b_{n-1}{\|p_n\|^2  \over \|p_{n-1}\|^2 } ‚â†¬†0.
$$



‚àé

**Corollary (orthonormal 3-term recurrence)** If
$\{q_n\}$ are orthonormal then $c_n = b_n$.

**Proof**
$$
b_n = ‚ü®x q_n, q_{n+1}‚ü© = ‚ü®q_n, x q_{n+1}‚ü© = c_{n-1}.
$$
‚àé



**Corollary (3-term recurrence, 1st form)**
If $\{p_n\}$ are OPs then there exist real constants $A_n ‚â† 0$, $B_n, $and C_n$
such that
$$
\begin{align*}
p_1(x) &= (A_1 x + B_1) p_0(x) \\
p_{n+1}(x) &= (A_1 x + B_1) p_n(x) - C_n p_{n-1}(x)
\end{align*}
$$

**Proof**

Follows from
$$
\begin{align*}
p_1(x) &= ({x \over b_0}  - {a_0  \over b_0}) p_0 \\
p_{n+1}(x) &= ({x \over b_n}  - {a_n  \over b_n}) p_n(x) - {c_{n-1} \over b_n} p_{n-1}(x)
\end{align*}
$$

‚àé

The three-term recurrence can also be interpreted as a matrix known
as the Jacobi matrix:

**Corollary (Jacobi matrix)**
For
$$
P(x) := [p_0(x) | p_1(x) | ‚ãØ]
$$
then we have
$$
x P(x) = P(x) \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix} a_0 \\ c_0 \\
                                                        b_0 & a_1 & c_1 \\
                                                        & ‚ã± & ‚ã± & ‚ã±
                                                        \end{bmatrix}}_X
$$
More generally, for any polynomial $a(x)$ we have
$$
a(x) P(x) = P(x) a(X).
$$

**Remark** If you are worried about multiplication of infinite matrices/vectors
note it is well-defined by the standard definition because it is banded.
It can also be defined in terms of functional analysis.

**Remark** Typically the Jacobi matrix is the transpose $J = X^‚ä§$. 
If the basis are orthonormal then $X$ is symmetric and they are the same.


##¬†2. Classical orthogonal polynomials

Classical orthogonal polynomials are special cases with a number
of beautiful properties, for example
1. Their derivatives are also OPs
2. The are eigenfunctions of simple differential operators

As stated above orthogonal polynomials are uniquely defined by the weight
$w(x)$ and the constant $k_n$. We consider:

1. Chebyshev polynomials $T_n(x)$/$U_n(x)$: $w(x) = 1/\sqrt{1-x^2}$ or $\sqrt{1-x^2}$  on $[-1,1]$
2. Legendre polynomials $P_n(x)$: $w(x) = 1$ on $[-1,1]$.
3. Hermite polynomials $H_n(x): $w(x) = \exp(-x^2)$  on $[-‚àû,‚àû]$.

Other important families discussed are

1. Ultrapsherical polynomials
2. Jacobi polynomials
3. Laguerre polynomials


## Chebyshev

**Definition (Chebyshev polynomials, 1st kind)** $T_n(x)$ are orthogonal with respect to $1/sqrt{1-x^2}$
and satisfy:
$$
T_0(x) = 1, T_n(x) = 2^{n-1} x^n + O(x^{n-1})
$$


**Definition (Chebyshev polynomials, 2nd kind)** $T_n(x)$ are orthogonal with respect to $1/sqrt{1-x^2}$.
$$
U_n(x) = 2^n x^n + O(x^{n-1})
$$


**Theorem**
$$
T_n(x) = \cos n \acos x
$$
In other words
$$
T_n(cos(Œ∏)) = \cos n Œ∏.
$$


**Proof**

We need to show that $p_n(x) := \cos n \acos x$ are (1) graded polynomials,
(2) orthogonal w.r.t $1/\sqrt{1-x^2}$ on $[-1,1]$, and 
(3) have the right constant. Property (2) is immediate:
$$
\int_{-1}^1 {p_n(x) p_m(x) \over \sqrt{1-x^2}} {\rm d} x = 
\int_{-œÄ}^œÄ {cos(nŒ∏) cos(mŒ∏) \over \sqrt{1-cos^2 Œ∏}} \sin Œ∏ {\rm d} Œ∏ =
\int_{-œÄ}^œÄ cos(nŒ∏) cos(mŒ∏) {\rm d} x = 0
$$
if $n ‚â†¬†m$. 

To see that they are graded we use the fact that
$$
x p_n(x) = \cos Œ∏ \cos n Œ∏ = {\cos(n-1)Œ∏ + cos(n+1)Œ∏ \over 2} = {p_{n-1}(x) + p_{n+1}(x) \over 2}
$$
In other words $p_{n+1}(x) = 2x p_n(x) - p_{n-1}(x)$.
Since each time we multiply by $2x$ and $p_0(x) = 1$ we have
$$
p_n(x) = (2x)^n + O(x^{n-1})
$$
which completes the proof.

Buried in the proof is the 3-term recurrence:

**Corollary**
$$
x ùêì(x) = ùêì(x) \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1/2 \\ 1 & 0 & 1/2 \end{bmatrix} 
$$

## Legendre

Legendre: $P_n(x)$ are orthogonal polynomials with respect to $w(x) = 1$ on $[-1,1]$, with
$k_n = $
