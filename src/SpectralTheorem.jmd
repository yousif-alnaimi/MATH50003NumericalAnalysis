# Spectral theorem for symmetric and normal matrices

Here we review the proof of the spectral theorem for symmetric and normal
matrices, as well as adjoints (complex-conjugation).

## 1. Adjoints

The adjoint of a matrix


## 2. Spectral theorem for symmetric matrices





**Theorem (spectral theorem for symmetric matrices)** If $A$ is symmetric
($A = A^⊤$) then
$$
A = Q Λ Q^⊤
$$
where $Q$ is orthogonal ($Q^⊤Q = I$) and $Λ$ is real.

**Proof**

Recall every eigenvalue $λ$ has at least one eigenvector $𝐪$ which we can
normalize, but this can be
complex. Thus we have
$$
λ = λ 𝐪^⋆𝐪  = 𝐪^⋆ A 𝐪 = 
$$
